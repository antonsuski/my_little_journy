# Conclusion

Literal is the one of the bacis constatns type. Litarals are implemeted into code direclty. This mean that the CPU don't need to instantiate literals and store them into memmory.

```
int a = 5; // 5 integral literal
char b = 'c' // 'c' literal
char* a = "Hello" // "Hello" litreal with size 6. '\n' are counted.
float c = 3.14 // 3.14 double literal
bool d = true // "ture" is boolean literal
```
Literal Suffix is very usful thing. E.g. l, u, z, uz, f, s, sv
