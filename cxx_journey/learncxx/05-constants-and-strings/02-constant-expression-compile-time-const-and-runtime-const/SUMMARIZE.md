# CONCLUSION

Constants values are very strong thing. This subsection overview at least two constatns:
Constants in side of subsection:
- Copilation Constants
- Runtime Constants

The **Compilation Constants** are very strong because thy can tell compiler make some optimizations.
After compiler will see **Compilation Constant** it won't store it im memmory. So the value will be
implemented as **Literal Constatn**.

This optimization called **Constant expression optimization**.
