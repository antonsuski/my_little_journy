# Conclusion

Be aware while comparing two floating point numbers. It can be dangerouse due to rounding error.

The best way to compare two floating point numbers is to use epsilone function. It was described
by Donald Knuth. The maing idea is to use some epsilon number which specify precision of comparing.
But if you whant to compare with number which close to 0 you have to emprove algorithm.
