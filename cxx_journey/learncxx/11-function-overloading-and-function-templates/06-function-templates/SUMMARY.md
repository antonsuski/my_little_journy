# Conclusion

Funcitons templates is vey strong feature that could help us to summaraize types. And take over with infint overloded functions. For making this possible you have to do the similiar steps like in an exaple:

```cpp
template<typename T> // declare template with new typename
T max(T x, Ty)       // define function with declared typename placeholder
{
    return (x < y) ? y : x;
}
```
